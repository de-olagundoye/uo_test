# uo_test 
**DEMO**: http://de-olagundoye.github.io/uo_test/

Required Features:

1. (✓) Create a mobile-first responsive grid of images. Specifically, on mobile-size screens, images should stack one image on top of another, on tablet-size screens stack 2 across, and the largest, desktop, images should be 3 across (see mockups for image placement). 
2. (✓) You must accomplish this task with some sort of grid framework. You can use any framework you'd like, including but not limited to Foundation, 960.gs, Skeleton, etc.
3. (✓) Please commit the final project to your github account for us to review. It should include your .html file, .css file, and an image directory.

Extra Credit:

1. (✓) Add a hover state to the images
2. (✓) Use a CSS preprocessor like SASS or LESS
